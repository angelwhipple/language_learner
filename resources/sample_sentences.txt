The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
She sells seashells by the seashore
How now, brown cow
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers
A big black bear sat on a big black rug
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream
The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain
Red lorry, yellow lorry
Betty Bother bought some butter
A noisy noise annoys an oyster
The cat sat on the mat
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Can you can a can as a canner can can a can
The cow jumps over the moon
The sun sets in the west every evening
A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Bright blue birds fly high in the sky
He thought he could, but he couldn't
